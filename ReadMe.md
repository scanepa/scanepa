  # Hi, I'm Stefano Canepa

I'm a developer and system administrator lost in the cloud. I'm bad at doing both things, but I keep working hard to improve. 

I'm a free software user and advocate, and I'm trying to convince everyone to move to free software and support it in any way they can. 

I'm currently working at Hewlett Packard Enterprise as a system software engineer. I write code to make different systems speak to each other. 

While not in front of a screen, I like swimming and cycling.

I love ice cream. My favourite flavours are chocolate, stracciatella, and pistachio.

You can reach me by sending an e-mail to **sc@linux.it**
